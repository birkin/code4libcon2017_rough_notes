### participatory design / empathy

[link](http://2017.code4lib.org/talks/Participatory-User-Experience-Design-with-Underrepresented-Populations-A-Model-for-Disciplined-Empathy)

co-creation, co-determination

power relations, paying attention to traditionally underrepresented populations

UXUP Project

- to support and empower native students

- to incorporate alternate design input

- frustrations from interviews
    - intimidated by library, people not known

- me: enough to reach out / survey TM populations, and then incorporate solutions that can benefit all? or is that missing an important piece of specifically targetting the solution?

- experience survey -- desired vs actual -- those facets are good; find that slide

- "predict next year's headlines" -- cool idea

Products of participatory design -- practical & political

Barriers -- one, standardization

### language & the software creation proces

[link](http://2017.code4lib.org/talks/Changing-the-Conversation-How-language-influences-the-software-creation-process)

(not programming language)

terms:
    - we: features, stories, apis... what and how
    - users: easy, useful, etc


user-driven vs feature-driven
    - emptathy why problems
    - tech how solutions

me: when problem occurs, or feature proposed, keep in mind how this will affect user

connect library technology to strategy: 'how will this x help students in the U.?'

solving right problem: "be safe", "street == hold hands"

audio-books -- back to 1930's, for blind

contextual inquiry -- observing use, unstructured -- eg, benefit of knowing how a circulation workflow works

focus groups, beliefs, desires

good caution of focusing on features re RFP -- good point for GFA meeting -- can end up with product feature-rich but missing the user-mark

### intentionally horrible markup

[link](http://2017.code4lib.org/talks/Intentionally-Horrible-Markup-Strategies-for-Testing-and-Enhancing-Web-Accessibility-on-a-Larger-Scale)

- web-accessibility: means that people with disabilities can use the web -- TB-Lee

- web-access testing, and validation

    - first: why?

- whose using the tools? devs, content-creators, auditors

- scale: being able to check entire websites

- sitewide vs page-level
    - sw: good for overview; learning curve; cost; because of configuration, can do "must" vs "should"
    - pl: good for iterative development; less-configurable; fewer validation rules; fewer exporting options

- selecting tools: how can we know what we don't know?
    - point: evaluate tools against clear set of criteria (horrible, and good to check for false positives)

- recommendations for testing
    - all know something about tools
    - on same page

- me: slack, Just heard a great talk on accessibility tools (on approach, not specific tools), and it made me think of a cool project we could do sometime. Some off-week everyone could choose a project to test for accessibility using page-level and site-level tools. We could either all use a similar suite of tools, or educate one-another about the tools. (and we could have standups to daily share our investigations!) talk-description: http://2017.code4lib.org/talks/Intentionally-Horrible-Markup-Strategies-for-Testing-and-Enhancing-Web-Accessibility-on-a-Larger-Scale

### The Most Accessible Catalog Results Page Ever

[link](http://2017.code4lib.org/talks/The-Most-Accessible-Catalog-Results-Page-Ever)

(from Pratt School of Information)

AXS == accessibility

integrate accessability thinking earlier

modals -- after the footer, so screen-readers can skip them

need proper ARIA markup for dynamic elements, so screen-readers are notified of page-changes

example of results: for sighted users, we want some metadata in brief-results
- great example of lists, vs h2s for subsections, vs tables -- each item is table row -- great for screen readers

### Protecting Me How? Understanding the Function of Privacy-Protection Technology Tools

[link](http://2017.code4lib.org/talks/Protecting-Me-How-Understanding-the-Function-of-PrivacyProtection-Technology-Tools)

- people express concern about online privacy, but few take action

- how does a design demonstrate that it's not collecting something? people like privacy and like feeling they're being protected

### From crowdsourcing to standardization: bridging the gap to open data

[link](http://2017.code4lib.org/talks/From-crowdsourcing-to-standardization-bridging-the-gap-to-open-data)

- open govt action plans
    - 2009, obama initiative
    - 2017 -- the open govenment data act

- trying to create a culture of open data without having much of an infrastructure to support it

- data catalog & expert network

- dc: tool that tells the public what datasets are available, what's include in them, and where to find them --

- data.gov is the holder, but requires data to be in a certain format to get pushed to it -- if I'm understanding this correctly

- crowdsourcing... using micro-volunteering

- experts.gov -- has high-level support and has been included in high-level action plans, but implementation has been slow and spotty

    - diverse measures of expertise
    - harvesting metadata from trusted sources
    - internal and public-facing layers

### A technical debt approach to metadata management

[link](http://2017.code4lib.org/talks/A-technical-debt-approach-to-metadata-management)

overview...
- absent or low-quality metadata hinders discovery
- difficulty of measuring costs of metadata management activities
- technical debt as a framing device

1992 -- ward cunningham, cost-deferred to push out a feature on a deadline (principle on that debt, interest accrues that makes fixes later harder)
- intentional, you know you've deferred things
- unintentional, you may not know what you'll have to do

- prudent and reckless debt -- eg you're not going to do something the right way now because it'll be a good training opportunity

- code debt, design debt, infrastructure debt, documentation debt

- [Exploring the costs of technical debt management --- a case study](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwif27W2_MfSAhVCxlQKHe8PAj8QFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdl.acm.org%2Fcitation.cfm%3Fid%3D2887277&usg=AFQjCNHB3oQhszG6qVLI_kj1_lrQna-fqw)

- metadata as the library's code base
    - it's role in meeting user needs -- can identify technical debt

- measuring quality
    - minimum record guidelines
    - user testing to identify resource discovery needs
        - measuring metadata's fitness for those needs
        - (probably) revising minimum record guidelines

- goal, making & measuing progress (time) toward paying off TD

- concern: cost measurement as a bottleneck

### Information Architecture: what is it and where does it fit?

[link](http://2017.code4lib.org/talks/Information-Architecture-what-is-it-and-where-does-it-fit)

- IA roots in design; Richard Saul Wurman -- for structuring information in any medium, then web-tech
    - different systems, eg navigation, search, etc
    - focus on users, usability

- users, creators, champions
    - champions (folk who enable creators)

- what an IArchitect does: UX, develop taxonomies, wireframes, forge & maintains expectations & avenues of communications
    - artifacts are usually a product of their time (paper blueprints old, spreadsheets)

### Defending against Denial of Service attacks

[link](http://2017.code4lib.org/talks/Boxing-the-Hydra-Defending-against-Denial-of-Service-attacks)

- ddos

- heinlein's razor, variant -- "but don't rule out malice"

- wrote filter that blocks IP address that make too many search requests too quickly 10 requests in 20 seconds, blocked for 60 seconds -- and the ban time gets extended if they continue

- hundreds of ips at once, but slow enough that not blocked by filter
    - tried fail2ban.org software -- looks for patterns
        - took too long to process apache logs as new ips were added to the ddos
            - he took some code from fail2ban, extracted some parsing code into awk/grep, and had a cron job run fail2ban on that, took 2 minutes instead of hours

project groups
- leader

too many products reflect siloed info.

### lightning talks...

#### MQTT -- lightweight tcp/ip protocol for publish-subscribe
- ian
- mosquitto
- just publish to a topic; hierarchical
- QoS levels, from 0 to 2 (2 being once, with 4-step handshake)
- reason: bandwidth and battery-life
    - http polling is expensive
- lots of libraries to work with this

#### Patron data

what are we keeping?

PII-1 - data about person

PII-2 - data about a person's activities

how to balance patron privacy with operational needs?

case 1, data warehouse
- all data going into warehouse is de-identified, and an id is sha-256 with salt

case 2, city open data initiative
- they should be good to go, but still concerns about fuzzy-matching
- 3 data points -- know how other data-sets can affect your data

Vendors have lots of data
